# HTML-Scrape-and-Analysis-Week-11-Challenge-
Data Bootcamp Week 11 HW - HTML Scrape and Analysis
This homework was scrape and analysis using HTML and pandas on a website that contained data about temperatures on Mars.  
The challenge was to scrape data from the website and use it to analyze trends in the Martian temperatures.

I used Xpert Learning, followed some of my professor's code, and used code from previous assignments. 
Specifically, I used pandas code from week 5 and the Xpert Learning to plot the majority of my graphs.
